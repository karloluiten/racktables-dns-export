racktables-dns-export
=====================

The racktables-dns-export.py script allows you create zones files from racktables data.
It needs a 'aliases' (comma seperated) attribute for your servers to do cnames.

This is an alpha release. (Heavy) tweaking might be needed on your side.

This is written for python2.6. If it would have been 2.7, the program would have been nicer (more DRY in the open() statements)
